# GitHub Actions Self-Hosted ARM64 MacOS Runner

The goal of this project is to have a pool of Mirego hosted runners in addition to the runners provided by GitHub. Those runners will be executed inside an ARM64 MacOS machine which should help speed up iOS builds.

## Architecture

### High Level Overview

Mirego will have a few machines hosted on premise. Those machines will be able to pick up jobs just like the GitHub hosted machines. The self-hosted runners will include tags in order to be explicitely chosen inside the workflows (`self-hosted`, `ARM64`, `mirego`...).

### Inside a Runner

In order to simplify maintenance and to increase the runner's reliability and the build's repeatability, each runner will run inside an ephemeral VM. This way, whenever a runner picks up a job, the workspace is assured to be in a clean state. This will also allow us to install and upgrade tools inside the VM and replicate it to every other machines.

A typical run-loop looks like this:

1. The _host_ machine generates a token from the GitHub API.
2. The _host_ machine launches a virtual machine (_guest_) with a cloned virtual disk.
3. The _host_ machine initiates an SSH connection to the _guest_ using a pre-defined hostname.
4. The _host_ machine launches the "runner" software pre-installed on the VM using the generated token.
5. The _guest_ machine waits for a job and executes it.
6. The _guest_ machine de-registers the runner from the GitHub organisation.
7. The _host_ machine shuts down the VM
8. The _host_ machine deletes the cloned virtual disk
9. Repeat

## Setup the Host

### UI

- In the initial macOS setup
  - Use `admin` as the username for the initial user
- After the macOS setup, adjust the machine‚Äôs preferences:
  - Sharing ‚Äî Enable Screen sharing
  - Sharing ‚Äî Enable Remote access (SSH/Remote Desktop)
  - Sharing ‚Äî Edit machine hostname (`gh-shr-XX`)
  - Energy ‚Äî Disable sleep
- Put the screen in sleep mode

### CLI

- From your local machine, copy your public SSH key (eg. `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`) to the machine

  ```
  # You‚Äôll be prompted for admin‚Äôs password just this one time
  $ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub admin@<HOST_IP>
  ```

- Still from your local machine, copy a few files from this repository

  ```
  $ scp .zshrc admin@<HOST_IP>
  $ scp .vimrc admin@<HOST_IP>
  ```

- On the remote machiine, install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)

  ```
  $ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
  ```

- Install `tmux` and `wget`

  ```
  $ brew install tmux wget
  ```

- Install [macosvm](https://github.com/s-u/macosvm)

  ```
  $ wget https://github.com/s-u/macosvm/releases/download/0.1-2/macosvm-0.1-2-arm64-darwin21.tar.gz
  $ tar -xzf macosvm-0.1-2-arm64-darwin21.tar.gz
  $ mkdir Bin
  $ mv macosvm Bin
  $ mkdir vm
  ```

- Configure the setup

  - From your local machine, copy the launch script into the remote machine‚Äôs `vm` directory

    ```
    $ scp launch.sh admin@<HOST_IP>:vm
    ```

- Configure the rest of the setup
  ‚ö†Ô∏è **This part is still a work in progress**

  - Configure the value for `GITHUB_API_TOKEN` in `vm/launch.sh`
  - Add the private SSH key to communicate with the VM
  - Fetch the rest of the `vm` directory content from another host machine (using cryptic/fancy `scp` commands)

- Start tmux and launch a new runner!

  ```
  $ tmux
  $ cd vm
  $ ./launch.sh mirego-XX
  ```

- Detach from tmux with (press `^B`, release and then `d`)

- Logout from the remote machine

  ```
  $ exit
  ```

- üéâ

## Create a new VM

- Download a Mac OS recovery image. The download URL can be found [here](https://ipsw.me/).
- Create the VM
  - The VM should have enough space for all the necessary tools.
  - Example command: `./macosvm --disk disk.img,size=128g --aux aux.img -c 8 --restore UniversalMac_Restore.ipsw vm.json`
  - The VM configuration is saved to the specified JSON file.

## Setup the VM

1. Start the VM in a non-ephemeral mode
   - `./macosvm vm.json -g`
2. Go through the MacOS initial setup
   - Username: `runner`
   - Password: `runner`
3. Enable remote access (SSH)
4. Set the hostname for the SSH communication to `githubrunnervm`
5. Add the public key to the allowed list
   - From the host machine, you can run `ssh-copy-id runner@githubrunnervm.local` to copy the public key to the guest
6. Disable automatic updates
7. Disable sleep
8. Enable passwordless `sudo`
   - `sudo visudo`
   - Edit to have `%admin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL`
9. Download [the runner](https://github.com/actions/runner/releases)
   - Make sure to download the ARM64 version, otherwise everything will run through Rosetta
10. Install Homebrew
    - `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`
11. Install Xcode from the website
    - Must be downloaded from the [website](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) as the App Store is currently disabled inside a VM
    - Make sure to start Xcode once to install all the components
12. Install the Android SDK
13. Install additionnal tools from Homebrew
    - `jq`
    - `curl`
    - `wget`
    - `firebase-cli`
    - `awscli`
    - `rbenv`, `ruby-build` and `rbenv-bundler`
    - `python3`
14. Set the required environment variables
    - Variables can be defined in the `.env` file in the runner folder
    - `ImageOS` must be set to `macos{VERSION}`
    - `XCODE_13_DEVELOPER_DIR` must point to Xcode's path
    - `PATH` should include all the installed binaries

Example `.env` file:

```
LANG=en_CA.UTF-8
ImageOS=macos12
XCODE_13_DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode-13.app/Contents/Developer
XCODE_14_DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
ANDROID_HOME=/Users/$USER/Library/Android/sdk
PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin:/opt/homebrew/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/Library/Apple/usr/bin:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
```

## Caveats

- GitHub's cache action will not work across different architectures
- The `ruby/setup-ruby` action will not work as there are not ARM64 binaries provided at the moment. A workaround is to use rbenv.
